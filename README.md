##### August 10, 2022 (Day 6): Public Key Cryptography & Cryptographic Hash Functions

When someone sends you cryptocoins over the Blockchain, they are actually sending them to a hashed version of what’s known as the “Public Key”.
Public key A is used to encrypt or perhaps lock messages and private key A is decrypts messages but only if they were encrypted with the matching public key A.

A hash function takes as its input just about any kind of digital data; numbers, text, images, videos, ebooks of any size. And outputs what seems like a long string of random characters. It can also be called a digest, but we'll just call it a hash.
A blockchain uses hash functions in order to create a record of the data recorded to the blockchain so any change to a single piece of data is easily identified.
The hashing algorithm used by the Bitcoin blockchain is SHA-256, which stands for Secure Hashing Algorithm, with a hash length of 256 bits.
The Ethereum blockchain uses a hashing algorithm called Ethash.
